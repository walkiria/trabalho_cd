'Cause ah, ah, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight

Shoes on, get up in the morn'
Cup of milk, let's rock and roll
King Kong, kick the drum
Rolling on like a Rolling Stone

Sing song when I'm walking home
Jump up to the top, LeBron
Ding-dong, call me on my phone
Ice tea and a game of ping pong

This is gettin' heavy
Can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (woo-ooh)
Life is sweet as honey
Yeah, this beat cha-ching like money

Disco overload
I'm into that, I'm good to go
I'm diamond, you know I glow up
Hey, so let's go

'Cause ah, ah, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight (hey)
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, woah

Bring a friend, join the crowd
Whoever wanna come along
Word up, talk the talk
Just move like we off the wall

Day or night, the sky's alight
So we dance to the break of dawn
Ladies and gentlemen, I got the medicine
So you should keep ya eyes on the ball, huh

This is gettin' heavy
Can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (woo-ooh)
Life is sweet as honey
Yeah, this beat cha-ching like money

Disco overload
I'm into that, I'm good to go
I'm diamond, you know I glow up
Let's go

'Cause ah, ah, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight (hey)
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, woah

Dynanana-nanananana-nanana, life is dynamite
Dynanana-nanananana-nanana, life is dynamite
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, woah

Dynanana-nananana, eh
Dynanana-nananana, eh
Dynanana-nananana, eh
Light it up like dynamite

Dynanana-nananana, eh
Dynanana-nananana, eh
Dynanana-nananana, eh
Light it up like dynamite

'Cause ah, ah, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite

(This is, ah)
'Cause ah, ah, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight (ah)
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, woah (light it up like dynamite)

Dynanana-nanananana-nanana, life is dynamite (life is dynamite)
Dynanana-nanananana-nanana, life is dynamite (oh-oh)
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, woah

There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
