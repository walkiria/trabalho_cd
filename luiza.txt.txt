Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down

With somebody who loves me

With somebody who loves me
Somebody who, somebody who

To hold me in his arms oh
I need a man who'll take the chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
